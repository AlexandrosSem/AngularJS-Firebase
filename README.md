This is a personal website-blog in which is made using AngularJS and Firebase. The Firebase is a cloud database in which in combination with the AngularJS it allows 3-way-data-binding which means you can update a value of a field on the dom and this will update the controller variable of AngularJS and this finally will update the field in the database.

The purpose of this blog is for the users to create their own articles and share their knowledge because knowledge is power!
